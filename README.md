# Sequential Image Viewer

## What and why

Shows an image inside a webview, maximized to its width. But more importantly, there's also left and right arrow buttons to switch the image to another image in the same folder, sequentially ordered by filename.

## Build
```yarn install``` to install dependencies and then ```./node_modules/vsce/vsce package``` to make it into a VSIX package.
